# hello-world
Just the first repository for toying around and trying some stuff

At first, we will try to edit the readme file.
The GitHub Hello World Tutorial says, I shoul dwrite something about myself, but I think, that gets a little personal.
I personally would rather like, that the whole tutorial woould be from the command line or the terminal, but it uses the browser-based interface, which I do not prefer at all.
